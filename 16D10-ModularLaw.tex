\begin{document}
Let $_RM$ be a left $R$-module with submodules $A, B, C$, and suppose
$C \subseteq B$.  Then
\[ C + (B \cap A) = B \cap (C+A) \]

This result shows that the submodules of $_RM$, partially ordered by inclusion, form a modular lattice with $\cap$ as the meet and $+$ as the \PMlinkname{join}{Join}.
