Assume that $R$ is a ring. We will consider right $R$-modules.

\textbf{Definition 1.} We will say that an $R$-module $M$ is of \textbf{weak dimension} at most $n\in\mathbb{N}$ iff there exists a short exact sequence
$$\xymatrix{
0\ar[r] & F_n\ar[r] & F_{n-1}\ar[r] & \cdots\ar[r] & F_1\ar[r] & F_0\ar[r] & M\ar[r] & 0
}$$
such that each $F_i$ is a flat module. In this case we write $\mathrm{wd}_{R}M\leqslant n$ (also we say that $M$ is of finite weak dimension). If such short exact sequence does not exist, then the weak dimension is defined as infinity, $\mathrm{wd}_R M=\infty$.

\textbf{Definition 2.} We will say that an $R$-module $M$ is of weak dimension $n\in\mathbb{N}$ iff $\mathrm{wd}_{R}M\leqslant n$ but $\mathrm{wd}_R M\not\leqslant n-1$.

The weak dimension measures how far an $R$-module is from being flat. Let as gather some known facts about the weak dimension:

\textbf{Proposition 1.} Assume that $M$ is a right $R$-module. Then $\mathrm{wd}_RM=n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ if and only if for any left $R$-module $N$ we have
$$\mathrm{Tor}_{n+1}^R(M,N)=0$$
and there exists a left $R$-module $N'$ such that
$$\mathrm{Tor}_{n}^R(M,N')\neq 0,$$
where $\mathrm{Tor}$ denotes the Tor functor.

Since every projective module is flat, then we can state simple observation:

\textbf{Proposition 2.} Assume that $M$ is a right $R$-module. Then
$$\mathrm{wd}_RM\leqslant\mathrm{pd}_RM,$$
where $\mathrm{pd}_RM$ denotes the projective dimension of $M$.

Generally these two dimension may differ.
