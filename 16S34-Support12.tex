\newcommand{\supp}{\operatorname{supp}}
\begin{document}
Let $R[G]$ be the group ring of a group $G$ over a ring $R$.

Let $x = \sum_g x_g g$ be an element of $R[G]$.  The \emph{support} of $x$, often written $\supp(x)$, is the set of elements of $G$ which occur with non-zero coefficient in the expansion of $x$.

Thus:
$$\supp(x) = \{ g \in G \mid x_g \neq 0 \}.$$
