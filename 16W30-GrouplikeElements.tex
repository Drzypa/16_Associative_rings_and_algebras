Let $(C,\Delta,\varepsilon)$ be a coalgebra over a field $k$.

\textbf{Definition.} The element $g\in C$ is called \textit{grouplike} iff $g\neq 0$ and $\Delta(g)=g\otimes g$. The set of all grouplike elements in a coalgebra $C$ is denoted by $G(C)$.

\textbf{Properties}. $0)$ The set $G(C)$ can be empty, but (for example) if $C$ can be turned into a bialgebra, then $G(C)\neq\emptyset$. In particular Hopf algebras always have grouplike elements.

$1)$ If $g\in G(C)$, then it follows from the counit property that $\varepsilon(g)=1$.

$2)$ It can be shown that the set $G(C)$ is linearly independent.
