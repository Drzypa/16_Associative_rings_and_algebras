\begin{document}
Let $(C,\Delta,\varepsilon)$ and $(D,\Delta',\varepsilon')$ be coalgebras. Recall, that if $D_0\subseteq D$ is a subcoalgebra, then $(D_0,\Delta'_{| D_0},\varepsilon'_{| D_0})$ is a coalgebra. On the other hand, if $I\subseteq C$ is a coideal, then there is a canonical coalgebra structure on $C/I$ (please, see \PMlinkname{this entry}{SubcoalgebrasAndCoideals} for more details).

\textbf{Theorem.} If $f:C\to D$ is a coalgebra homomorphism, then $\mathrm{ker}(f)$ is a coideal, $\mathrm{im}(f)$ is a subcoalgebra and a mapping $f':C/\mathrm{ker}(f)\to\mathrm{im}(f)$ defined by $f'\big( c+\mathrm{ker}(f)\big) =f(c)$ is a well defined coalgebra isomorphism.
