\subsection*{Abstract definition}

Let $F$ be a field and $V$ be an $F$-vector space with basis
$\{P_i\}_{i\in I}\cup\{Q_i\}_{i\in I}$, where $I$ is some non-empty
index set. Let $T$ be the tensor algebra of $V$ and let
$J$ be the ideal in $T$ generated by the set
$\{P_i\otimes Q_j-Q_j\otimes P_i-\delta_{ij}\}_{i,j\in I}$ where
$\delta$ is the Kronecker delta symbol. Then the quotient $T/J$ is the
\emph{$|I|$-th Weyl algebra}.

\subsection*{A more concrete definition}

If the field $F$ has characteristic zero we have the following more
concrete definition. Let $R:=F[\{X_i\}_{i\in I}]$ be the polynomial
ring over $F$ in indeterminates $X_i$ labeled by $I$. For any $i\in
I$, let $\partial_i$ denote the partial differential operator with
respect to $X_i$. Then the $|I|$-th Weyl algebra is the set $W$ of all
differential operators of the form
\begin{equation*}
D=\Sum_{|\alpha|\leq n}f_\alpha\partial^\alpha
\end{equation*}
where the summation variable $\alpha$ is a multi-index with $|I|$
entries, $n$ is the degree of $D$, and $f_\alpha\in R$. The algebra
structure is defined by the usual operator multiplication, where the
coefficients $f_\alpha\in R$ are identified with the operators of left
multiplication with them for conciseness of notation. Since the
derivative of a polynomial is again a polynomial, it is clear that $W$
is closed under that multiplication.

The equivalence of these definitions can be seen by replacing the
generators $Q_i$ with left multiplication by the indeterminates $X_i$,
the generators $P_i$ with the partial differential operator
$\partial_i$, and the tensor product with operator multiplication, and
observing that $\partial_iX_j-X_j\partial_i=\delta_{ij}$. If, however,
the characteristic $p$ of $F$ is positive, the resulting homomorphism
to $W$ is not injective, since for example the expressions
$\partial_i^p$ and $X_i^n$ commute, while $P_i^{\otimes p}$ and
$Q_i^{\otimes n}$ do not.
