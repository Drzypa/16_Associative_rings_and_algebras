Let $A$ be an associative, finite-dimensional algebra over a field $k$. Throughout all modules are finite-dimensional.

A right $A$-module $T$ is called a \textbf{partial tilting module} if the projective dimension of $T$ is at most $1$ ($\mathrm{pd}T\leqslant 1$) and $\mathrm{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$.

Recall that if $M$ is an $A$-module, then by $\mathrm{add}M$ we denote the class of all $A$-modules which are direct sums of direct summands of $M$. Since Krull-Schmidt Theorem holds in the category of finite-dimensional $A$-modules, then this means, that if
$$M=E_1\oplus\cdots\oplus E_n$$
for some indecomposable modules $E_i$, then $\mathrm{add}M$ consists of all modules which are isomorphic to
$$E_1^{a_1}\oplus\cdots\oplus E_n^{a_n}$$
for some nonnegative integers $a_1,\ldots, a_n$.

A partial tiliting module $T$ is called a \textbf{tilting module} if there exists a short exact sequence
$$
0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow T' \rightarrow T'' \rightarrow 0
$$
such that both $T',T''\in\mathrm{add}T$. Here we treat the algebra $A$ is a right module via multiplication.

Note that every projective module is partial tilting. Also a projective module $P$ is tilting if and only if every indecomposable direct summand of $A$ is a direct summand of $P$.
