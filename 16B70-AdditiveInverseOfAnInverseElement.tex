\begin{document}
In any ring $R$, the additive inverse of an element $a \in R$ must exist, is unique and is  denoted  by $-a$.  Since $-a$ is also in the ring $R$  it {\em also} has an additive inverse in $R$, which is  $-(-a)$.  Put $-(-a) = c \in R$.
Then by definition of the additive inverse,
$-a + c = 0$ and $-a+a = 0$. Since additive inverses are unique, it must be that
$c = a$.
