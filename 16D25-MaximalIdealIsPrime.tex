\textbf{Theorem.}  In a commutative ring with non-zero unity, any maximal ideal is a prime ideal.

{\em Proof.}\, Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of such a ring $R$ and let the ring product $rs$ belong to $\mathfrak{m}$ but e.g. \,$r \notin \mathfrak{m}$.  The maximality of $\mathfrak{m}$ implies that\, 
$\mathfrak{m}\!+\!(r) = R = (1)$.\, Thus there exists an element \,$m \in \mathfrak{m}$\, and an element\, $x \in R$\, such that\, $m\!+\!xr = 1$.\, Now $m$ and $rs$ belong to $\mathfrak{m}$, whence
       $$s = 1s = (m\!+\!xr)s = sm\!+\!x(rs) \in \mathfrak{m}.$$ 
So we can say that along with $rs$, at least one of its \PMlinkname{factors}{Product} belongs to $\mathfrak{m}$, and therefore $\mathfrak{m}$ is a prime ideal of $R$.
