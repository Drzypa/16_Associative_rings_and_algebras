\DeclareMathOperator{\rann}{r.ann}
\begin{document}
Let $R$ be a ring.  If the set of annihilators
$\{ \rann(x) \mid x \in R\}$
satisifies the ascending chain condition, then
$R$ is said to satisfy the \emph{ascending chain condition on right annihilators}.

A ring $R$ is called a \emph{right Goldie ring} if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators and $R_R$ is a module of finite rank.

\emph{Left Goldie ring} is defined similarly.  If the context makes it clear on which side the ring operates, then such a ring is simply called a \emph{Goldie ring}.

A right Noetherian ring is right Goldie.
