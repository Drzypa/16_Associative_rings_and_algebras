Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category and $M\in\operatorname{Ob}(\mathcal{A})$ such that a projective resolution of $M$ exists:
$$\xymatrix{{\ldots}\ar[r]&P_n\ar[r]&{\ldots}\ar[r]&P_1\ar[r]&P_0\ar[r]&M\ar[r]&0}.$$
Among all the projective resolutions of $M$, consider the subset consisting of those projective resolutions that contain only a finite number of non-zero projective objects (there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $P_i=0$ for all $i\geq n$).  If such a subset is non-empty, then the \emph{projective dimension} of $M$ is defined to be the smallest number $d$ such that 
$$\xymatrix{0\ar[r]&P_d\ar[r]&{\ldots}\ar[r]&P_1\ar[r]&P_0\ar[r]&M\ar[r]&0}.$$
We denote this by $\operatorname{pd}(M)=d$.  If this subset is empty, then we define $\operatorname{pd}(M)=\infty$.

\textbf{Remarks}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item In an abelian category having enough projectives, the projective dimension of an object always exists (whether it is finite or not).
\item If $\operatorname{pd}(M)=d$ and 
$$\xymatrix{0\ar[r]&P_d\ar[r]&{\ldots}\ar[r]&P_1\ar[r]&P_0\ar[r]&M\ar[r]&0}.$$
Then $P_i\neq0$ for all $0\leq i\leq d$.
\item $\operatorname{pd}(M)=0$ iff $M$ is a projective object.
\item In the (abelian) category of left (right) $R$-modules, the projective dimension of a left (right) $R$-module $M$ is denoted by $\operatorname{pd}_R(M)$.
\end{enumerate}

Likewise, given an abelian category and a object $N$ having at least one injective resolution.  Then the \emph{injective dimension}, denoted by $\operatorname{id}(N)$ is the minimum number $d$ such that 
$$\xymatrix{0\ar[r]&N\ar[r]&I_0\ar[r]&I_1\ar[r]&{\ldots}\ar[r]&I_d\ar[r]&0},$$
if such an injective resolution exists.  Otherwise, set $\operatorname{id}(N)=\infty$.  This is the dual notion of projective dimension.
